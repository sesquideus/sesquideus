- Welcome to my GitHub README. I am Martin "Kvík" Baláž or @sesquideus
- I am an astronomer by both profession and passion, carefully balancing in between physics,
  mathematics and computer science. Currently I am a research scientist at Comenius University in Bratislava.
- Among my projects you may find
  - ASMODEUS or All-Sky Meteor Observation Detection Efficiency Simulator, a virtual meteor observatory and its C++/Qt port
  - DeGeŠ, an automated document build system for competitions (correspondence [seminars](https://fks.sk/) and [Náboj](https://physics.naboj.org/)),
    lecture / tutorial materials or virtually anything that requires highly structured and templated documents. Written in XeLaTeX, make and Python + jinja2
  - ubi, a kernel density estimation framework for arbitrary multidimensional metric spaces (C++)
  - AMOS database and dashboard that monitors and stores data from the network of all-sky meteor cameras
    [AMOS](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/microsites/daa/division-of-astronomy-and-astrophysics/research/meteors/amos/)
  - a virtual plate corrector for all-sky cameras
