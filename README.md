Welcome to my GitHub profile README. My civil name is Martin Baláž and I can be often find under the alias @sesquideus.

- I am an astronomer by both profession and passion, carefully balancing somewhere between physics, mathematics and computer science.
- Currently I work as a pipeline developer for METIS, Mid-Infrared [ELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_Large_Telescope)
  Imager and Spectrograph at the University of Vienna.
- In my free time I am also the lead software engineer of the
  [AMOS](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/microsites/daa/division-of-astronomy-and-astrophysics/research/meteors/amos/)
  project at Comenius University and a backend developer for NGO [Trojsten](https://trojsten.sk/).

Among my projects you may find
- ASMODEUS or All-Sky Meteor Observation Detection Efficiency Simulator, a virtual meteor observatory and its C++/Qt port
- DeGeŠ, an automated document build system for competitions (correspondence [seminars](https://fks.sk/) and [Náboj](https://physics.naboj.org/)),
  lecture / tutorial materials or virtually anything that requires highly structured and templated LaTeX/HTML documents.
  Written in XeLaTeX, make and Python + jinja2, uses lots of pandoc
- ubi, a kernel density estimation framework for arbitrary multidimensional metric spaces (C++)
- AMOS database and dashboard that monitors and stores data from the network of all-sky meteor cameras
