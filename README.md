- Welcome to my GitHub README. I am Martin "Kvík" Baláž or @sesquideus
- I am an astronomer by both profession and passion, carefully balancing in between physics,
  mathematics and computer science. Currently I work as a pipeline developer for the Mid-Infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph at the University of Vienna.
- In my free time I am also the lead software engineer of the AMOS project at Comenius University and a shadow backend developer for NGO [Trojsten](https://trojsten.sk/).

Among my projects you may find
- ASMODEUS or All-Sky Meteor Observation Detection Efficiency Simulator, a virtual meteor observatory and its C++/Qt port
- DeGeŠ, an automated document build system for competitions (correspondence [seminars](https://fks.sk/) and [Náboj](https://physics.naboj.org/)),
  lecture / tutorial materials or virtually anything that requires highly structured and templated documents. Written in XeLaTeX, make and Python + jinja2
- ubi, a kernel density estimation framework for arbitrary multidimensional metric spaces (C++)
- AMOS database and dashboard that monitors and stores data from the network of all-sky meteor cameras
  [AMOS](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/microsites/daa/division-of-astronomy-and-astrophysics/research/meteors/amos/)
- VASCO, a virtual all-sky corrector plate for all-sky cameras
